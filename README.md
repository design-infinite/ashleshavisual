Hi, I am Ashlesha Kelkar an artist, visual Designer, UI/UX designer specialised in typography. 

My technological savvy comes from education (Master in Fine Art) in typography, photography and a professional background in e-learning industry as well as graphics-multimedia industry. I worked for film production house, advertising agencies, and software e-learning companies as Visual Designer for more than a decade. I have 10 + years of professional experience in visual design and have been a volunteer/Consultant designer for last two years. I also enjoy working with acrylics, oil and some mixed media, primarily due to my passion towards creativity. I can pretty much paint on any surface and enjoy playing with colors.

My inspiration came from growing up in a fast city and the beautiful combination of nature and city life of India. I am currently looking for suitable opportunities in visual and interaction design, user experience, and e-learning fields.
